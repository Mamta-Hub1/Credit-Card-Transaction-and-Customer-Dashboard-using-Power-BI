Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI & Postgresql


Credit Card Dashboard & Customer Dashboard Project
•	Designed and developed interactive Credit Card dashboards, including:
1.	Credit Card Dashboard to analyze overall revenue, transactions, and customer trends.
2.	Credit Card Customer Dashboard to track individual customer activity, transactions, and product usage.
•	Used Postgresql Database for data storage, cleaning, and transformation — performed joins, aggregations, and filtering to prepare analysis-ready data
•	Created DAX measures to calculate KPIs:
1	Total Revenue
2	Total Transaction Amount & Count
3	Customer Count
4	Week-over-Week changes
•	Built visualizations to analyze Revenue, Transaction Amount, and Customer behavior by Gender, Category, Region, and Age Group.
•	Provided actionable insights identifying key trends, such as higher revenue contribution from male customers or peak transaction periods, helping management optimize marketing and retention strategies.
•	Tools: Power BI, DAX, Postgresql, Power Query, Data Modeling, Data Visualization



Credit Card Transaction Database Terms:
1. Credit Card Limit
•	This is the maximum amount a customer is allowed to spend on the card.
•	It is decided by the bank based on income, credit score, repayment history, and risk profile.

2.Revolving Balance / Outstanding Balance
•	The remaining unpaid amount that is carried over to the next billing cycle.
•	When a customer does not pay the full amount, the remaining balance becomes revolving balance.
•	Interest (finance charges) is charged on this amount.

3. Average Utilization Ratio
•	Measures how much of the credit limit the customer is using on average.
•	Formula:
Utilization Ratio (%) = (Total Outstanding / Credit Limit) × 100

5. Delinquent Account
A Delinquent Account is a credit card account where the customer has not paid the minimum due amount by the due date.
It reflects missed or late payments.
# Delinquency is measured by Days Past Due (DPD)
Common buckets in banking:
Bucket	                 Meaning
0 DPD	      No delinquency (current account)
1–30 DPD	       Minor delay
31–60 DPD	       Early stage delinquency
61–90 DPD	       Sub-standard
>90 DPD	       NPA (Non-Performing Asset) / written off risk

6. Customer_Acq_Cost:    Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for one customer:
How much money the bank spent to bring that customer in.
How we find it
Banks spend money on:
•	Ads
•	Sales people
•	Offers & gifts
•	Verification cost
This money is spent to get new customers.
So we do:
Money spent to get customers/Number of customers gained=Cost for each customer
Example
Bank spent ₹1,00,000 to run a credit card ad.
From that ad, they got 100 customers.
So:
₹1,00,000 ÷ 100 = ₹1,000 per customer
➡ ₹1,00,000 ÷ 100 = ₹1,000 per customer




➡ Each customer cost ₹1,000 to acquire
Each customer cost ₹1,000 to acquire
