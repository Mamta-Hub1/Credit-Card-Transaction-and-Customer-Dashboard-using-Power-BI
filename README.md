3.Customer Count
4.Week-over-Week changes

Credit Card Transaction Database Terms:
1. Credit Card Limit
•	This is the maximum amount a customer is allowed to spend on the card.
•	It is decided by the bank based on income, credit score, repayment history, and risk profile.

2.Revolving Balance / Outstanding Balance
•	The remaining unpaid amount that is carried over to the next billing cycle.
•	When a customer does not pay the full amount, the remaining balance becomes revolving balance.
•	Interest (finance charges) is charged on this amount.

3. Average Utilization Ratio
•	Measures how much of the credit limit the customer is using on average.
•	Formula:
Utilization Ratio (%) = (Total Outstanding / Credit Limit) × 100

5. Delinquent Account
A Delinquent Account is a credit card account where the customer has not paid the minimum due amount by the due date.
It reflects missed or late payments.

6. Customer_Acq_Cost:    Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for one customer:
How much money the bank spent to bring that customer in.
How we find it
Banks spend money on:
•	Ads
•	Sales people
•	Offers & gifts
•	Verification cost
This money is spent to get new customers.
So we do:
Money spent to get customers/Number of customers gained=Cost for each customer
Example
Bank spent ₹1,00,000 to run a credit card ad.
From that ad, they got 100 customers.
So:
₹1,00,000 ÷ 100 = ₹1,000 per customer
➡ ₹1,00,000 ÷ 100 = ₹1,000 per customer




➡ Each customer cost ₹1,000 to acquire
Each customer cost ₹1,000 to acquire
